# Pro club leveling up glitch for volta

Requirements: install all the requirements from the txt file, I recommend using pycharm for this

Install https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki 

64 bit exe link: https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.2.0.20220712.exe

Ensure the pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe' line in the code lines up to your installation location

Set the script up on the vlota search game button and just leave it, your mouse may interfere with the script if you 
aren't careful.

Leave it and good luck
